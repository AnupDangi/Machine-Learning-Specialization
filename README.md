# This is the course 1(Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification)

This course has taught me the basic algorithm of machine learning ie how to use linear regression to create a model and mathematics behind the implementation and many more.

- Topics Learned are:
1.Linear Regression
2.Multi variable Linear Regression
2.Non-Linear Regression
3.Sigmod Function
4.Scikit-Learn
4.Logistic Regression

## Projects
- I have created a BreastCancerDetection model using Logistic Regression which you can check out.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AnupDangi/Machine-Learning-Specialization.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Supervised Machine Learning Regression and Classification
```

Install all the required libraries ie pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scikit-learn and few others.

Here is the example below.Similarly install all of them.
```bash
  pip install pandas
```

 Run locally i mostly prefer jupyter notebook 
Each block of code or run it manually by clicking run button
```bash
  Ctrl+Enter 
```
## If you are here for learning purpose then prefer the main course and parallely study from here this will be helpful for you.

## Suggestion:
Don't just blindy clone and scroll through the code try to understand and practice.
I have added juypter notebook prefer that as well to understand the concepts summary.
## If you really want to learn and want lecture vidoes then contact me in my social account.
